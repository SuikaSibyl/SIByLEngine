# SIByLEngine 2023.1

`SIByLEngine` is a personal toy game engine by [@SuikaSibyl](https://github.com/SuikaSibyl). I am planning to keep working on it for a long time and implement lots of realtime & offline effects in it.

Previous version could be find in: [SibylEngine2021](https://github.com/SuikaSibyl/SibylEngine2021). Version 2023 is a complete refactoring including better and more extendable structure, solution, design.

## Builds

Only support Windows platform and MSVC compiler for now.


By default, Nvidia GPU with Turing or higher architecture is required to correctly run the examples, as vulkan hardware raytracing is defaultly used. If no corresponding GPU exists, compilation should still be successful, but you should manually turn off ray-tracing-related features to run it without fatal error.


### Compiliation Instruction

The compilation is tested on Windows 11 machine with Visual Studio 2022 (11.17.2, older version should also work).

1) Download Vulkan SDK from [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows), and install it. This is mandatory to enable Validation layer, which is helpful for potential error detection. Test compilation uses VulkanSDK-1.3.290.0 (latest release), but moderately older version should also work.
2) Open the SIByLEngine.sln solution with VisualStudio 2022.
Select "Sandbox" project as target and hit compilation. It will take some time, but ideally you should eventually be able to compile everything without getting error. You should be able to compile with any GPU, but to run the default example you will need a NV GPU supporting hardware ray tracing.
3) Download scene binaries from [google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_tCI2eo3ASknxz26kWvQJBKBTgsoL9Eh/view?usp=drive_link), uncompress it in root folder so that its "Sandbox" folder overlaps with the "Sandbox" folder already exists.
4) You should be able to run the example hopefully.


## Design Decisions
- `NOT Use C++ 20 Module` for the all the modules. Although I had previously used it extensively and found it to be a great feature. Despite MSVC's support for the feature, compilation is not always stable, sometimes resulting in weird 'internal error' messages that force the process to be abandoned. Moreover, as the project grows, both IntelliSense and ReSharper struggle to provide proper code highlighting and intelligent code completions, which makes coding extremely painful. Also, analysising the project eat up all the memory quickly and get the IDE and compiler super slow... Given these challenges, I have opted to deprecate the feature.

- `Only Support Vulkan Backend` for RHI module. It seems that there are some API logistic differences between Vulkan / OpenGL / DirectX. But the main reason is probably simply because I am too lazy to implement and test for all the backends for now. As Vulkan is supporting most of the features exists, I find no good reason to support other backends at this stage.

- `Use Render Graph` to manage GPU pipeline. The main motivation is that Vulkan is too verbose about memory barriers. Render graph helps me to support automatic barrier insertion (within the graph) and resource management. It may also be a good idea to do automatic barrier insertion at a lower layer like RHI, which may be helpful to support a more flexible pipeline, but I am not sure with that for now.
