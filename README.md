# SIByLEngine 2024.0

`SIByLEngine` is a toy game engine developed by [@Haolin Lu](https://github.com/SuikaSibyl). 
I plan to continue working on it in the long term and implement many real-time and offline graphics algorithms.

## Core Features:
- Use [`Vulkan`](https://www.vulkan.org/) as Rendering Hardware Interface (RHI) backend.
- Use [`Slang`](https://shader-slang.com/) as default shading language.
- Render Dependency Graph (RDG) for automatic pipeline arrangment and barrier insertion.
- Provide `Python` API, supporting interoperation between `PyTorch`, `CUDA` and `SIByL` (Vulkan).
